# Sovits
Here is my Elon Musk Model with 285600 steps in Sovits

Github link: https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc

I will update the project if I train more steps in this model.

It is good for you guys to use. Please add credit to the GitHub link and my account name.

Due to the limit of the storage size, I will delete the smallest step of the model and add the highest one.

Work in speech. not quite work in sing haha!
